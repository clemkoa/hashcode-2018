Display command line syntax using `python run.py -h`

Standard syntax is `python run.py [-s] file_name strategy`
`-s` flag is for solver use (ommit for standard algo run)
`file_name` is the name of the input file (no extension, `all` for all files)
`strategy` is the name of the function that will be called in `algo.py`

Add flags and arguments using the lists at the top of `algo.py` and `solver.py`
